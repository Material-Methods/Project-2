# Task Analysis

Material Methods : Erick Cruz, Aqueel Miqdad, Viktor Koves

# Main Page - Calendar
- Color Green is un appealing to the eye and remind me of vomit.
- Color can represent the season of the year (Spring)
 Combinations can be included as Nature – Fresh and Bright
#F98866, #FF420E, #80BD9E, #89DA59

 This is a welcome sight after a long winter break when you have not seen any bright colors, colors can also be changed for text and selected tab that you are in
- Title of the page – ITMD 362
- Homework Schedule
 Task Due and the assignment title can be moved closer to the middle.
 Unnecessary space is being used with small amount of information to be given.
 Links to the projects and labs are fine. (Redirects to repository for Labs and Projects redirect to deliverables)
# Project
-Projects can be separated in a different manner instead of changing the whole background of the project a different color.
Bar
Move project into an organized box
# Syllabus
- Grading table seems to be a little close to the side. Looks off from the whole website and a bit distracting
Short the box so it can be aligned with text and not off
Can also link Projects under the table? (Suggestion only to help students looking at the syllabus)
# Links
- If you are under a different tab then Calandra, such as Projects or Syllabus, you are transferred over to Calendar tab if you press Links. Possibility make a separate page?
- Course subject links can be underlined to be more organized.
- Technical Specification” can change different bullet point because it is using the same bullet point underneath the parent.
