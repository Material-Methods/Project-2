##Self-Critique - Erick Cruz
There was a lot of points that were taken off that was a simple mistake that each one of us should have caught. A big lesson learned because those points could of easily been avoided if we have checked with the Validator at the end and instead of in-between. In a real job, this would of been vital and learned that we need to be more detailed in web design because small mistakes like this can make a huge impact. Overall, I feel like I have learned a lot more about human interaction between computers, instead of just thinking that there was no process besides just building a functioning website.
